utils/banners.py
--------------------
Shared helper for the optional media banners registered via
"ثبت تصویر [کلید]" (see handlers/admin_commands.py's set_image) - a banner
can be a still photo, a GIF (animation), or a short video; this is the one
place that knows how to send whichever type was registered, so every
caller (start, راهنما, پنل, بن, میوت/سکوت, ...) doesn't have to.

Used by:
    handlers/start_command.py   -> key "start_banner"
    handlers/help_command.py    -> key "help_banner"
    handlers/panel_command.py   -> key "panel_banner"
    handlers/admin_commands.py  -> keys "ban_banner", "mute_banner"
    music/panel_io.py           -> key "music_hub_banner"

Adding a new bannered command is: pick a key, call send_banner() with a
fallback to a plain bot.reply_to/send_message if it returns falsy.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: the actual bot.send_photo/send_animation/send_video
method is looked up at CALL time (getattr(bot, name) inside send_banner),
never captured as a bound method at import time - `core.bot` is a shared
singleton, and grabbing a bound method reference at module-import time
would silently keep pointing at whatever that method was when this module
first loaded (breaks under test mocking, and is fragile in general).
